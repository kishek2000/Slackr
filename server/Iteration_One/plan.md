Main Planning Process:-

Previously in Iteration one, we followed our own steps of Agile development by looking to create draft versions of our tasks at hand, before coming together and discuss our progress. From these discussions and meetings, we would then redevelop our new steps required to be implemented, to complete these tasks, and this repeated until our group was satisfied and content with our progress. 

For Iteration 2, we intend to pursue the same process of Agile. Firstly, without the Iteration 2 spec we still have a preconception or base idea of what the second iteration will entail.

With this current software system, we see that there are two key entities - a user, and the app. Within the entity of the app, we have the functions that are defined to us already, which we want to implement in a logical order and in a way that does not prevent us from adapting to any last minute change of requirements from the other entity - the user. This desire to be adaptable will be a core discussion that we will open our Iteration 2 spec breakdown with. Based on this, we have currently planned for our order of implementation to be:

    - User Registration and Access Functionality (week 1 of Iteration 2)
        - Including our processing and interpretation of tokens
    - Admin Privileges (week 1 of Iteration 2)
    - Channel, Messages and Search functions (week 2 of Iteration 2)
    - Additional Features: (week 3 of Iteration 2)
        - Standup
        - User Profile

To then follow by:

    - Arrival of Iteration 2 spec -> conduct breakdown;
    - Breakdown of spec will involve;
        - Meetings
            - Face to face
            - Discord + CodeShare + Google Drive
        - Clarifications between members of any inconsistencies or confusions about the system
        - Questions to ask tutors or on Piazza, for further consolidating this clarification process
        - Understanding a solid structure of what tasks are truly at hand, after breaking down the new Iteration requirements. 
    - Enter our Agile cycle, which is presented in the chart at the bottom of this document. 
        - In summary, it entails a process where we delegate tasks between members unanimously and fairly, accompanied by deciding 
          which tasks require collaboration and which can be achieved with just individual work. From this, we will complete a draft 
          of our functions, based on the order that we decide to complete them in. Then, we will regather as a group in a meeting and 
          reflect on what we have done, give feedback to each other and ask more questions if required, before restarting the cycle and 
          then implementing the new feedback and changes. This will occur until we have a finalised product. 
        - Development of Timeline
            - Gantt Chart
                - Create Milestones
                - Create Dates based on availability of everyone    
                - Delegate tasks
    - Implement functions
    - Implement tasks
    - Review progression and completion of tasks
    - Plan for Iteration 3
    - End iteration
    
This plan overall, is subject to change based on our breakdown of the spec which is yet to come for Iteration 2.
