Main Planning Process:-

Previously in Iteration one, we followed our own steps of Agile development by looking to create draft versions of our tasks at hand, before coming together and discuss our progress. From these discussions and meetings, we would then redevelop our new steps required to be implemented, to complete these tasks, and this repeated until our group was satisfied and content with our progress. 

For Iteration 2, we intend to pursue the same process of Agile. Firstly, without the iteration 2 spec we still have a preconception or base idea of what the second iteration will entail.

With this current software system, we see that there are two key entities - a user, and the app. Within the entity of the app, we have the functions that are defined to us already, which we want to implement in a logical order in a way that does not prevent us from adapting to any last change of requirements. Based on this, we have planned for our order of implementation to be:

    - User Registration and Access Functionality (week 1)
        - Including our processing and interpretation of tokens
    - Admin Privileges (week 1)
    - Channel, Messages and Search functions (week 2)
    - Additional Features: (week 3)
        - Standup
        - User Profile

To

    - Iteration 2 spec -> coming soon 
    - Breakdown of spec, delegation of tasks, set milestones, schedule work based on availability of everyone
        - Meetings
            - Face to face
            - Discord + CodeShare + Google Drive
    - Draft our tasks -> delegate tasks -> draft complete each -> come back together and review -> feedback, questions, 
      adapt our changes and feedback -> rebegin the cycle
        - Development of Timeline
            - Gantt Chart
                - Create Milestones
                - Create Dates based on availability of everyone    
                - Delegate tasks
    - Implement functions
    - Implement tasks
    - Review progression and completion of tasks
    - Plan for Iteration 3
    - End iteration
