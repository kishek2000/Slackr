How we can improve:-

        - Ensuring enough time was allocated to work on milestones
        - Our initial process of coding tests individually introduced several inconsistencies, which
          we only noticed in our group session of checking the code after our first draft.
          These should be clarified earlier.
        - This initial process also reflected different subtlties in our individual styling, so we 
          should clarify a consistent style guide earlier
      	- Use piazza more to find the answer to common problems
