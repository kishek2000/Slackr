# Teamwork

## How often you met, and why you met that often

Various meetings were held during during iteration three, over a range of platforms including **Google Hangouts** , **Facebook Messenger,** and **face-to-face meetings**. At the beginning of the iteration, we set up a _gantt chart_ to schedule our timeline for iteration 3, these milestones were:

* (4/11 - 17 /11)

* Pylint and Testing  - (4/11 - 17 /11)

* Software Engineering Design Principles - Functions (4/11 - 13/11)

* Adapt changes - (4/11 - 5/11)

* Frontend Group Demo - (8/11)

* ER Diagram - (10/11)

* Teamwork - (14/11 - 15/11)

* Completed Draft Meeting (15/11)

* Finalisation Meeting (16/11)

* Iteration 3 Due (17/11)

## What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful

**As we had planned our iteration schedule in advance, we were aware of milestones that had to be met on specific dates.** Due to this forward planning, we were able to talk about our covered content during meetings. On the day of the meeting we would also let each other aware of the time that we are free. **Using Google Hangouts,** we were able to share each other&#39;s screens, _enabling us to show problems and to get help from other group members._ This would allow for productive meetings and enhanced communication.

## Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code

Akin to previous iterations, we primarily worked on the code that we had written for the previous iterations. These function divisions were as follows:

* Auth; Shoan

* Channel; Adi

* Message; Liam

* User Profiles; Harry

* Standup; Shoan

* Search; Harry

* Admin; Harry

As this iteration revolved around finalising the implementation into the front-end, we experienced many errors. Some of these errors were as a result of miscommunication, improper code implementation or so on. In the case of miscommunication, we would often solve try to solve the issue ourselves. If we were unable to solve the issue, then we would contact the person who is most familiar with the code to try to get them to look at the issue. With these situations, there was more overlap with writing code, and cross checking that code is working as intended. We also had overlap when writing decorators.

## What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration three

Through our constant process of refactoring and enhancing our code as explained in SEPrinciples.md, a common encounter for us was **debugging errors which had little to medium effects on the integrated components of the system.** Often, we would experience this through the user perspective from frontend testing and _realising certain issues that should not occur in the functionality of the Slackr App, as per the specification._ In these times, we simply took a **step-by-step approach of debugging, using Inspect Element, terminal displays of the HTTP requests and our pytests.** These were generally the only points in time where our progression through the _system refactoring_  slowed down. In general, by having an already _functional backend with the frontend after iteration two,_ **our process was very streamlined and errorless.**

## How did we implement effective Agile practices? Did you constantly manage some form of a task board?

Throughout the whole project timeline, our team has **heavily practiced the concept of iterative sprints where we complete a certain draft for a finale milestone, come together and amend changes from each other&#39;s feedback, and then re-sprint and repeat until a result is reached.** Throughout this iteration, this was no different as we began with adapting the functionality of the new spec and essentially made sure we had a finalised functional product. **Even though this encountered the need to debug in future refactoring of our functions, it was better to start with a functional beginning.** After this initial adaptation, we then went through our refactoring process and implementation of design principles in a logical manner, which is all highlighted clearly in our principles.md file.

The most important part of working together as a team and implementing such development processes **are the assignments of tasks and the clear noting of their status of completion, from each person.** From the beginning, although we committed to adding user stories into the task board, _we rathered implementing a Google Spreadsheet with our Gantt Chart, and then discussing daily about where everyone is currently placed and what people have left to do, through calls often done on Google Hangout and Discord, as well as daily messaging on Facebook Messenger._

An image of our Gantt Chart is attached in our repository, labelled &quot;Gantt\_Chart.pdf&quot; and we will be showing this in the presentation in our lab day.

Ultimately, our **chemistry and even workload,** as well as **satisfaction with the quality of work of each other,** allowed us to successfully follow our plan for this Iteration and implement Agile practices.
